# Design of Experiment: T9 Predictive Text
Abstract:
The popular T9 text input system for mobile devices uses a predictive dictionary-based disambiguation scheme, enabling a user to type in commonly-used words with low overhead. Several simple predictions for systems intended to facilitate text production for handicapped individuals. The schemes are based in single-subject language models, where the system is self-adopting to the past language use of the subject. Sentence position, the immediately preceding one or two word and initial letters of the desired words are cues which may be used by the system

Requirements:
- OpenMP 3.1+ support 
(Usually comes with the latest MinGW or TDM-GCC compiler)
TDM-GCC: https://sourceforge.net/projects/tdm-gcc/
MinGW: https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/

- Code::Blocks: http://www.codeblocks.org/
